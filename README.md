# Bat-Image-Utils
a bunch of batch files i have

gimme ideas. im too lazy to think of htem myself

Some of the scripts are very cpu intensive, and many of them have froze my computer for long periods of time, so if that happens, add that as an issue 'cause i'm pretty sure i got most of them but i might missed one

you need ffmpeg and imagemagick for most of them

I apologize for the horrible commit names, i can't explain my own work
