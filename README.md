# Bat-Image-Utils
a bunch of batch files i have

gimme ideas. im too lazy to think of htem myself

also im switching to manjaro arch linux so ima be converting these scripts to .sh or smth soon

the arch one might need more cpu power, idk 

Some of the scripts are very cpu intensive, and many of them have froze my computer for long periods of time, so if that happens, add that as an issue 'cause i'm pretty sure i got most of them but i might missed one

you need ffmpeg and imagemagick for most of them

I apologize for the horrible commit names, i can't explain my own work
